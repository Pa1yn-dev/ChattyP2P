# ChattyP2P
 
ChattyP2P is a simple P2P (peer to peer) chat application built with a TCP server to allow communication.

One user runs the server application while another connects to it using the client application included in the source files.

***

Branch layout is as follows:
* [dev](https://github.com/Pa1yn-dev/ChattyP2P/tree/dev) - Development branch, features are added often in stages and are not always fully functional as they get worked on, therefore making dev unsuitable for production.
* [stable](https://github.com/Pa1yn-dev/ChattyP2P/tree/stable) - Current stable version of the software.
